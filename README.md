# wechat_pickoneforyou

A wechat app, used to be deployed on sina cloud (but I closed it after several months) </br>

the app is built for people who always have trouble making decisions on choosing from several options </br>

It takes in a question and several options, returns a ranked option list to the user based on results from hybrid algorithms.</br>
(atm only based on search engine result analysis)

 - May come to this project later in my life, coz it's really helpful, to myself
 - May try some deep learning approaches in making best decisions
